# DDOS-Script
Repo containing a penetration testing DDOS script.

In implementing a DDOS script we need to send requests to a host on a specific port over and over again. This can be done with sockets. To speed the process up and make it more effective, we will use multi-threading as well.

We need the targetâ€™s IP-address, the port we want to attack and our fake IP-address that we want to use. Fake IP - address doesn't necessarily make you anonymous.
